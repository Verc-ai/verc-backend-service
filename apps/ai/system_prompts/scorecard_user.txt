     * answer = false, score = 0 (if behavior is NOT present or NOT satisfied)
     * answer = null, score = null (if question is NOT APPLICABLE or CANNOT BE INFERRED)
   - SERVICING questions: Use 0-10 grading scale (NOT binary)
     * score = integer from 0-10 based on strict grading scale (see SERVICING section)
     * answer = true if score ≥ 7, answer = false if score < 7
     * answer = null, score = null (if question is NOT APPLICABLE or CANNOT BE INFERRED)

     * answer = true/false, score = 0, 50, or 100 (see COLLECTIONS section)
     * answer = null, score = null (if question is NOT APPLICABLE)
7. Use null/N/A when:
   - The question is conditional and the condition is not met (e.g., "if applicable", "if POE call", "if no third party")
   - The question cannot be determined from the transcript (e.g., documentation accuracy, internal processes not visible)
   - The situation described in the question did not occur and cannot be evaluated
8. Never invent facts or infer intent.
9. If uncertain whether behavior occurred, use false/0 (not null) for compliance, or lower scores (0-5) for servicing.
10. All scores must be integers or null (null for N/A questions).
11. Overall scores must follow the formulas exactly (N/A questions are excluded from calculations).
12. Do NOT default any question to true or high scores.
13. If the same behavior appears in multiple questions, answers MUST be consistent.

PII REDACTION INTERPRETATION (MANDATORY)
The transcript may contain redacted PII in either format:
- Square brackets: [PERSON_NAME], [ADDRESS], [COMPANY_NAME], [DATE_TIME], [LOCATION]
- Angle brackets: <PERSON>, <ADDRESS>, <COMPANY_NAME>, <DATE_TIME>, <LOCATION>

Rules:
- [PERSON_NAME] or <PERSON> means the customer WAS identified.
- Multiple [PERSON_NAME] or <PERSON> entries indicate first AND last name.
- [ADDRESS] or <ADDRESS> or similar indicates verification WAS completed.
- [DATE_TIME] or <DATE_TIME> indicates date/time information was present.
- [LOCATION] or <LOCATION> indicates location information was present.
Never penalize due to redaction. Both formats are equivalent proof that the information was present.

COLLECTIONS SCORE
==========================
⚠️ CRITICAL: Only evaluate this section if "Collections" intent is detected in detected_intents array.

⚠️ HIERARCHICAL SCORING SYSTEM:
- Evaluate questions in order (1 → 2 → 3)
- If payment taken (Q1 = true): Score = 100, set Q2 and Q3 to null/N/A
- If no payment (Q1 = false) AND promise to pay set (Q2 = true): Score = 50, set Q3 to null/N/A
- If no payment (Q1 = false) AND no promise to pay (Q2 = false) AND deferment given (Q3 = true): Score = 50
- If none of the above: Score = 0

If Collections intent is NOT detected:
- Still include all 3 questions in the collections.questions array
- Set answer = false for all questions
- Set score = 0 for all questions
- Calculate overall_score using hierarchical scoring (all false = 0)

If Collections intent IS detected:
Evaluate each question with:
- "question": exact question text as shown below
- "answer": boolean (true/false) or null for skipped questions
- "score": integer points as specified or null for skipped questions

Questions to evaluate (HIERARCHICAL SCORING - evaluate in order):
1. "Was a payment taken?" 
   - If YES: Score = 100, skip remaining questions (set promise to pay and deferment to null/N/A)
   - If NO: Continue to question 2
   
2. "Was a promise to pay set?"
   - Only evaluate if payment was NOT taken
   - If YES: Score = 50, skip deferment question (set to null/N/A)
   - If NO: Continue to question 3
   
3. "Was a deferment given?"
   - Only evaluate if payment was NOT taken AND promise to pay was NOT set
   - If YES: Score = 50
   - If NO: Score = 0

Overall Collections Score Calculation (ALWAYS calculate if questions are evaluated):
- Use hierarchical scoring:
  - If payment taken: overall_score = 100
  - Else if promise to pay set: overall_score = 50
  - Else if deferment given: overall_score = 50
  - Else (all false): overall_score = 0
- Round to 2 decimal places
- If questions cannot be evaluated at all (no transcript data): set to null

==========================
LEGAL ISSUES DETECTION
==========================

- Customer threatened legal action

⚠️ CRITICAL NOTES:
- All compliance questions MUST be included in agent_score.compliance.questions array
- All servicing questions MUST be included in agent_score.servicing.questions array
- All 3 collections questions MUST be included in agent_score.collections.questions array (even if Collections intent not detected)
- Collections scoring is HIERARCHICAL: payment (100) > promise to pay (50) > deferment (50)
- If payment taken, set promise to pay and deferment to null/N/A
- If promise to pay set (and no payment), set deferment to null/N/A
- For N/A questions: answer = null, score = null (NOT false/0)
- N/A questions are EXCLUDED from score calculations (they don't count toward sum or max points)
- categories.compliance.score MUST equal agent_score.compliance.overall_score
- categories.servicing.score MUST equal agent_score.servicing.overall_score
- agent_score.overall_score MUST be calculated using the weighted formula below
- overall_weighted_score MUST equal agent_score.overall_score
- categories.compliance.feedback and categories.servicing.feedback should be descriptive text about the evaluation
- categories.compliance.issues and categories.servicing.issues should be arrays (empty [] if no issues, or list of issue descriptions if issues found)

OVERALL WEIGHTED SCORE CALCULATION
If Collections intent is NOT detected:
- Formula: 0.17 × compliance_score + 0.83 × servicing_score
- Round to 2 decimal places

If Collections intent IS detected:
- Formula: 0.10 × compliance_score + 0.50 × servicing_score + 0.40 × collections_score
- Round to 2 decimal places
