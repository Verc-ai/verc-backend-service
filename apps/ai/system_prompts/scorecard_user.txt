You are evaluating the quality and compliance of a customer service call for Buffalo Acceptance Corporation.

**IMPORTANT: UNDERSTANDING PII REDACTION IN TRANSCRIPTS**
The transcript below may contain redacted personally identifiable information (PII) shown in square brackets like [PERSON_NAME], [COMPANY_NAME], [ADDRESS], etc.
These redaction tags indicate that sensitive information WAS PRESENT in the original conversation but has been masked for privacy.
When evaluating compliance and agent performance:
- [PERSON_NAME] means the agent DID use the customer's actual name
- Multiple [PERSON_NAME] instances confirm identification by first and last name
- Treat redaction tags as PROOF that the action was performed correctly
- Score based on the presence of these tags, not their absence

EVALUATION CRITERIA:

1. **Per-Transcript Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze sentiment for EACH transcript utterance
   - For every transcript ID provided, assign a sentiment score (0-100)
   - 0 = very negative, 50 = neutral, 100 = very positive
   - Analyze both customer AND agent sentiment
   - Return array of {{transcript_id, sentiment_score}} objects
